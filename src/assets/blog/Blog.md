# Build Your Own Blog On Your Angular Site

### *This is a work-in-progress, a small sample of the workshop/tutorial and has not been shared publicly. If selected I will make it private until the conf and at that time, if desired, only be made available to attendees for some period of time before posting publicly (it will always be free content)*

## 0. Workshop Introduction

### Introduction

Hello my name is Steve Witman, I live in Boulder, Colorado, a beautiful 8 hour drive from here. I love Angular and I am also one of the co-orgainzers of the Angular Community Meetup.

This can be a free (for attendees) workshop done by myself or with one or more helpers (possibly othere Angular Community Meetup co-organizers) or a just a presentation (possibly with a co-presenter from the ACM) and with this supporting tutorial.

## 2. Angular Material and a Nav Component

> NOTE: For the sake of saving time and getting to our goal of building a blog more quickly today, we are using a schematic from Angular Material that generates a toolbar and a sidenav.<br><br>This is not required for this tutorial to work, and instead, you may choose to use your own navigation or just omit the navigation parts for now.

[Angular Material Installation and Code Generation](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics)

### 2.1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Add Angular Material

##### ng add @angular/material

Accept all the defaults

### 2.2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Use schematic to generate Nav Component

##### ng generate @angular/material:navigation nav

### 2.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace boilerplate in app.component.html with Nav Component

Select everyting in the AppComponent template file and relpace with the `<app-nav>` component.

###### app-component.html (before)

```
???
...
```

#### app.component.html

```
<app-nav></app-nav>
```

In the browser, if your app looks like the following, you need to stop and restart the server for the styles generated by the schematic to take effect.

It should look like this.

## 3. Home Component with routing

### 3.1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate standalone Home Component

We are using standalone components but we will still group each of our features in their own folders. For this Home feature we want to create the component in a `features/home` folder.

##### ng g c features/home/home --standalone

### 3.2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Update routing and nav with Home Component

Add these routes in `app-routing.module.ts`

#### app-routing.module.ts

```
...
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    redirectTo: 'home',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  },
  {
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent
  }
];
...
```

### 3.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Update Nav Component with link to home route

Update the menu in the Nav Component to route to the Home Component

###### app-routing.module.ts (before)

```
...
<mat-nav-list>
  <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 1</a>
  <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 2</a>
  <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 3</a>
</mat-nav-list>
...
```

#### app-routing.module.ts (after)

```
...
<mat-nav-list>
  <a mat-list-item routerLink="home">Home</a>
  <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 2</a>
  <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 3</a>
</mat-nav-list>
...
```

## 4. Create Blog Module with BlogList Component

### d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Update App Component

##### ng g m features/blog --routing





### e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Update Links in the Nav Component Template

Replace `<a mat-list-item href="#">Link 1</a>` with `<a mat-list-item routerLink="home">Home</a>` in the NavComponent template.

#### nav.component.html

```
...
  <mat-nav-list>
    <a mat-list-item routerLink="home">Home</a>
    <a mat-list-item routerLink="blog">Blog</a>
    <a mat-list-item href="#">Link 3</a>
  </mat-nav-list>
...
```
