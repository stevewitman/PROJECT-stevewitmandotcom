  <h4>Software Engineer<span class="pipe">|</span>Angular</h4>
  <p>
    I am currently available and looking for a Jr/Mid Angular role. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After many years of chasing the next hot new web and full-stack technologies, I finally decided to focus and become an expert in one primary technology - Angular! 
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2017, I founded the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/angularboulder/">Angular Boulder Meetup</a>  (in-person meetup). Today, I continue to run that meetup, help co-organizer the 4000+ member <a href="https://angularcommunity.net/home">Angular Community Meetup</a> (virtual meetup), and recently took over as the <a href="https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-boulder/">GDG Boulder</a> lead (in-person Google Developer Group).
  </p>
  <p>
    I created and maintain <a href="https://ngnuggets.com">ngNuggets.com</a>, a site with daily, hastily curated, Angular videos, blogs, podcasts and releases to highlight the best and new Angular content creators and aid in their discoverability ... really, though, it is just a side project to help me stay sharp, try new things with Angular and to stay connected with the Angular community!
  </p>
  <p>
    Please <a routerLink="contact">contact</a> me if you would like to talk Angular.
